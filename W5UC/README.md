# Four stack of 3-element 50 MHz yagis designed by W5UC

Simulation of the large vertical array (LVA) for 6-meters deployed at VHF contest station K5QE. Stacking distance 10 ft. Bottom antenna is 15 ft above
a perfect ground. Calculated peak gain is 16.1 dBd with takeoff angle of approximately 8.5 degrees.

Plots are for azimuth {left) and elevation (right) with ARRL log scaling.
