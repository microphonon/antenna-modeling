# 5-element loop fed array (LFA) antennas for 50 MHz

The design dimensions are taken from the G0KSC [website](https://www.g0ksc.co.uk/2013-yagis/50mhz-yagi/ "website") for boom lengths of 4.1, 4.4, 4.6, and 4.7 m. 
Files are included 
for i) free-space and ii) horizontal mounting 50 ft above perfect ground. Peak gain occurs close to 50.2 MHz and is found to be approximately 8.2, 8.4, 8.7, and 8.8 dBd, respectively.
Ground reflection can add close to 6 dB the calculated free-space gain.
